1. Version Control is a system that lets you save and revisit different versions of a file or project. A **Version Control System (VCS)** helps you go back to earlier versions, see what changed, who changed it, compare updates, and fix mistakes easily.

2. Cloning in Git means making a copy of an existing Git repository from a server. You do this using the **`git clone`** command and the repository’s URL.

    When you clone a repo:

    - All versions of all files are copied  
    - A new directory is created  
    - A `.git` folder is added  
    - Git checks out the newest version of the project  

        Example command:

        git clone https://github.com/test

3. The command used to track and stage files is **`git add`**.

    To stage a single file:  
        ```
        git add "filename"
        ```

    To stage all files:  
        ```
        git add .
        ```

4. Saving your changes in Git is called a **commit**, and Git creates a snapshot of your project when you commit.

    Commit staged changes with a message:

        git commit -m "any message here"


    Example with details:

        git commit -m "made change x,y,z"


    Commit all modified tracked files:


        git commit -a

---

5. To send your changes to a remote repository, referred to as "pushing changes", use:

        git push origin master


    This pushes your changes from the local **master** branch to the remote repository named **origin**. When you clone a repo, Git automatically names the original server **origin**.
