# What Is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to add formatting to plain-text documents. Created by **John Gruber** in 2004, it has become one of the most widely used markup languages.  
Unlike a WYSIWYG editor ( **W**hat **Y**ou **S**ee **I**s **W**hat **Y**ou **G**et ), where formatting appears instantly, Markdown uses simple syntax that remains readable even in its plain-text form.

# Why Do We Use Markdown?

- **Portability:** Markdown files can be opened by almost any application and aren’t locked behind proprietary formats.
- **Platform Independence:** Works on any device or operating system.
- **Future-Proofing:** Even if a Markdown app becomes unavailable, the text remains readable in any text editor.
- **Ubiquity:** Supported by GitHub, Reddit, documentation tools, note apps, and more.
- **Versatility:** Used for documents, websites, books, notes, presentations, emails, and technical documentation.

# Headings in Markdown

To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) before your text.

- **Largest heading:**  
  `# Heading 1` (one `#`)
- **Smallest heading:**  
  `###### Heading 6` (six `#`)

# Emphasis (Bold & Italics)

For maximum compatibility, especially inside words, use **asterisks**, not underscores.

- *Italic:*  
  `*italic text*`
- **Bold:**  
  `**bold text**`

# Links in Markdown

Use bracketed text followed by the URL in parentheses.

Example:  
`[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)`

You can add an optional title:  
`[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "Search Engine")`

# Unordered Lists

You can use any of the following symbols:

- Dash: `-`
- Asterisk: `*`
- Plus: `+`

**Best practice:** Pick one and use it consistently.
